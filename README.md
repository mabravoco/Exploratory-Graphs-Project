# Exploratory-Graphs-Project
Coursera Exploratory Data Analysis course - Graphs project

This assignment uses data from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, a popular repository for machine learning datasets. In particular, we will be using the “Individual household electric power consumption Data Set” which I have made available on the course web site:

Dataset: Electric power consumption [20Mb]

Description: Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years.
Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.

The repository contains 8 files: 4 graphic PNG files and the R code to create each one of the,
